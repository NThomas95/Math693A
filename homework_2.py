This is the code for the first homework assignment in M693A. The objective is to minimize the rosenbrock function, 
described by:

    f(x,y) = 100(y-x^2)^2 + (1-x)^2

We need to evaluate two methods: the steepest decent method and the newton direction method. The difference between this
homework and homework 1 is that we must use the zoom algorithm instead of the backtracking line search. It would be very
helpful to modularize this code.
